  Our pattern library is made up of documentation and structured HTML/CSS samples that help you build build websites and content that follow our style. We use it to build our main website and other projects. You can use it too.

The pattern library hosts and documents the little pieces of HTML, CSS and JavaScript we snap together to make <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org">our website</a> work the way it does.

The library will:

1. Help you to understand the different building blocks and how to use them
2. Provide HTML/CSS examples of components if you want to build additional page templates
3. Establish a framework for documenting additional components/templates as we create them

This pattern library is alive. As the design and function of our site changes, the pattern library will too.

We'll be adding more style resources for writing content and understanding our audiences in the future.

### Who should use the pattern library?
{: .styleguide-heading }

The short answer: anyone. You can use it for any project you want. (We give it away under the MIT license, see details below.)

The long answer: this pattern library is most useful for Code for America staff and network members who want to build on-brand websites or contribute to the front-end design and function on our main website. We're building it for the main website first, and breaking changes may occur in new releases to suit our needs.

Take a look at our [Github repository](https://github.com/codeforamerica/pattern-library) right now to learn how to use our patterns on your site.
