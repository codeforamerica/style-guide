          <h4>Who we're helping</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Hundreds of thousands of Bay Area residents are eligible for Prop 47 reclassification and other dismissal remedies to clear up old convictions on their criminal records.</li>
            <li>Legal Aid providers and county public defenders are the first points of contact when people need help accessing and changing their criminal records and they are significantly under-resourced.</li>
          </ul>
          <figure>

            <figcaption>This is an image figure with a caption</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h4>Our goals</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Redesign criminal background check process, in partnership with California Department of Justice and state Judicial Council, making it possible for hundreds of thousands of people to know if they qualify for Prop 47 reclassification and other dismissal remedies.</li>
            <li>Build pre-screening and intake tools that enable legal service providers to double the number of clients they can see in a day.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>The Problem</h4>
          <p>When people are trying to access these basic services, they don’t have weeks to waste trying to navigate an incomprehensible system. Prop 47 provides the legal framework for qualifying individuals to reduce previous low level, non-violent charges from a felony to a misdemeanor. However, the process of actually changing your record is extremely difficult. Here is why:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It is hard to know if you qualify for Prop 47 and many people may be better served by other existing record clearing mechanisms.</li>
            <li>In order to know what you qualify for, you need access to your criminal record (known as a RAP sheet), which typically requires a person to get fingerprinted at approved locations. This process costs $50, and it can take up to two months to receive the fingerprint card. RAP sheets also commonly contain inaccuracies or are missing key information. All of these challenges — limited access, readability, and accuracy — cause delays and bottlenecks in the record clearing process. Separately, they also cause qualified people with criminal histories to needlessly miss out on job opportunities.</li>
            <li>Once you’ve obtained your record, it’s really hard to understand your RAP sheet without a lawyer's help.</li>
            <li>If you have overcome all of these obstacles, which most people don’t, you have to request and pay for another RAP sheet to verify that your change was processed.</li>
            <li>The processes vary from county to county.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Code for America’s research has shown that when someone is trying to change their criminal record it is often because they have been denied a job or access to public housing. They need to be able to clear their record quickly, as the law intends. Addressing these process improvements can make a lasting impact in peoples' lives.</p>
          <h4>Our approach</h4>
          <p>For the past three months, Code for America has conducted extensive user research, working with legal aid offices, public defenders, district attorneys, county court officials, and citizens trying to change their records. Through this research, we mapped out the entire process and have identified the points within the system where technology interventions can improve the process.</p>
          <p>We believe that we can have the greatest impact on this issue by focusing on two key challenges:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Improving the state’s criminal background check process,</strong> in partnership with the California Department of Justice and the California Judicial Council. Our goal for this partnership is to reduce the amount of time it takes for someone to access their state RAP sheet, as well as to improve the quality of the RAP sheet, so it is both easier to understand and contains accurate information.</li>
            <li><strong>Making it easier for legal aid providers to efficiently process more applications.</strong> We are partnering with the San Francisco Public Defender’s office and anticipate launching partnerships in two additional Bay Area counties in 2016 to build a pre-screening tool that will help clients understand if they are eligible for Prop 47, another expungement mechanism, or neither. Doing this screening in advance means that legal aid offices are only seeing qualified clients and that applicants don’t have to unnecessarily spend their time waiting for an appointment if they ultimately won’t qualify.</li>
          </ul>
