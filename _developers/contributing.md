This styleguide is created as a Jekyll site.

To generate code previews, wrap the HTML you wish to preview in a `<div class="preview">` container. Code samples will automatically be generated from the code within the preview container. If you wish to include filler content (e.g., surrounding paragraphs) that are not included in the code sample, add the class `.is-peripheral` to the element.
